## **Introduction**

This project uses the **Food.com Recipes + Interactions** dataset, consisting of two large tables that together describe over 80,000 recipes and more than 700,000 user interactions.

### Dataset Size 

| Dataset        | Rows    | Columns |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| **Recipes**    | 83,782  | 12      |
| **Interactions** | 731,927 | 5       |

### Central Question

> **What factors help us predict how long a recipe will take to prepare (in minutes)?**

For everyday cooking, time is one of the most important constraints. Accurately estimating preparation time helps users:

- choose recipes that fit their schedule  
- avoid overly time-consuming dishes  
- plan meals efficiently  

The Food.com dataset is uniquely valuable because it combines detailed recipe structure (ingredients, steps, nutrition) with real user behavior (ratings and reviews) across tens of thousands of recipes.

This makes `minutes` an essential and practical prediction target.

### Relevant Columns for Prediction

For predicting preparation time (`minutes`), the most relevant variables include:

- **`n_steps`** : procedural complexity  
- **`n_ingredients`** : number of components required  
- **`nutritional features`** : calorie density, sugar, protein, etc.  
- **`step_bin`** : binned complexity level  
- **`engineered features`** : such as calories-per-ingredient and steps-per-ingredient  

These features describe recipe structure and complexity, which logically influence preparation time.


## **Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis**

### Data Cleaning

To make the recipes dataset usable for analysis and modeling, I performed several cleaning steps that reflect how the data were generated on Food.com:

1. **Merging recipes with user interactions**

   The raw data come in two files: `RAW_recipes.csv` (recipe metadata) and `RAW_interactions.csv` (user ratings and reviews).  
   On the website, each recipe can have many user interactions, but some recipes may have none.  
   To mirror this structure, I performed a **left merge** of recipes with interactions on `id` (recipe ID) and `recipe_id`.  
   A left merge preserves all recipes (even those without ratings), which is important because users can still view and cook unrated recipes.

2. **Treating 0-star ratings as missing (NaN)**

   On Food.com, users cannot actually give a 0-star rating. In practice, a `rating` of 0 in the interactions file indicates that the user left a review without selecting a star value.  
   Because a 0 here does **not** represent a true rating on the same scale as 1–5, I replaced all `rating = 0` values with `NaN`.  
   This avoids artificially pulling down average ratings and better reflects the true data-generating process: “no rating given” rather than “worst possible rating.”

3. **Computing average rating per recipe**

   After cleaning the ratings, I aggregated the interactions by recipe and computed an **average rating** for each `id`.  
   I then merged this average back into the recipes table as a new column, `average_rating`.  
   This creates a single, recipe-level dataset that summarizes user feedback and can be used directly in plots, hypothesis tests, and prediction models.

4. **Parsing the `nutrition` column into numeric features**

   The `nutrition` column originally stores a **string representation of a list** containing seven values:
   calories, total fat (%DV), sugar (%DV), sodium (%DV), protein (%DV), saturated fat (%DV), and carbohydrates (%DV).  
   Since these are meaningful numeric attributes that users see on recipe pages, I:
   - Converted each string to a real Python list,  
   - Split the list into seven separate numeric columns (`calories`, `total_fat`, `sugar`, `sodium`, `protein`, `saturated_fat`, `carbohydrates`), and  
   - Dropped the original `nutrition` string column.  
   This makes nutritional information much easier to analyze and include as features in models.

5. **Removing extreme outliers in `minutes`**

   The `minutes` column contains a few unrealistically large values (e.g., recipes recorded as taking tens of thousands of minutes).  
   These are likely data entry errors or artifacts of scraping, and they strongly distort visualizations and inflate error metrics like RMSE.  
   To obtain a more realistic and stable dataset, I restricted the data to recipes with preparation times between the **5th and 95th percentiles** of `minutes`.  
   This keeps the vast majority of plausible cooking times while trimming extreme outliers that do not reflect typical user experience.

Overall, these steps produce a cleaner, more interpretable recipe-level dataset that better reflects how the data arise on Food.com and supports meaningful exploratory analysis and modeling.


The cleaned dataframe ended up with 83782 rows and 19 columns. Because the full dataset contains many columns, I display only the most relevant ones for readability.Below is the head of the cleaned `recipes` DataFrame used for the rest of the analysis (scroll right to view more columns):

### Univariate Analysis

To better understand the structure of the dataset and the behavior of key variables, I first examined the distributions of several columns that are relevant to predicting preparation time. Since my prediction problem centers around the minutes variable, understanding its distribution is essential before building any models.

The distribution of preparation times is highly right-skewed. Most recipes take under 150 minutes, while a small number take significantly longer, creating a long tail. These extreme values motivated the removal of unrealistic outliers during data cleaning.

Interpretation: The strong right skew indicates that a large portion of recipes are quick to prepare, while only a few require exceptionally long cooking times.

### Bivariate Analysis

To explore how different recipe attributes relate to preparation time, I examined several pairwise relationships using scatter plots and trendlines. Understanding these associations helps identify meaningful predictors for modeling.

One of the relationships was the one between number of steps and preparation time. This relationship is one of the most important for the prediction problem, since the number of steps is a natural proxy for procedural complexity.

Interpretation: This plot reveals a weak but noticeable positive relationship between the number of steps and preparation time. Recipes with more steps tend to require longer cooking times, but the association is highly variable, even recipes with few steps can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. The log scale shows that prep times span multiple orders of magnitude, highlighting the complexity and diversity of recipe structures.

### Interesting Aggregates

To better understand patterns in recipe complexity and preparation time, I computed a grouped table summarizing average prep time and number of ingredients across different step ranges. Since the number of steps is one of the strongest indicators of recipe complexity, grouping recipes this way helps uncover structural patterns in the dataset.

The table below summarizes three aggregates for each step range:

| step_bin   |   minutes |
|:-----------|----------:|
| 0–5        |   30.574  |
| 6–10       |   43.2888 |
| 11–20      |   55.3458 |
| 21–40      |   75.968  |
| 41–80      |  102.516  |
| 80+        |  131      |

More complex recipes (those with many steps) tend to require more ingredients and significantly longer preparation times. However, the increase in prep time is not linear, some moderately-step-heavy recipes still have relatively short prep times, suggesting that factors beyond step count influence total cooking time. These aggregates helped guide feature engineering decisions in later modeling steps.
