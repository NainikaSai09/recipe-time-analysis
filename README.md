## Introduction

This project uses the **Food.com Recipes + Interactions** dataset, consisting of two large tables that together describe over 80,000 recipes and more than 700,000 user interactions.

### Dataset Size

| Dataset        | Rows    | Columns |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| **Recipes**    | 83,782  | 12      |
| **Interactions** | 731,927 | 5       |

### Central Question

> **What factors help us predict how long a recipe will take to prepare (in minutes)?**

For everyday cooking, time is one of the most important constraints. Accurately estimating preparation time helps users:

- choose recipes that fit their schedule  
- avoid overly time-consuming dishes  
- plan meals efficiently  

This makes `minutes` an essential and practical prediction target.

### Dataset Description

### **Recipes Table**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **`name`** | Recipe name |
| **`id`** | Recipe ID |
| **`minutes`** | Total minutes required to prepare the recipe |
| **`contributor_id`** | ID of the user who submitted the recipe |
| **`submitted`** | Date the recipe was submitted |
| **`tags`** | List of Food.com tags assigned to the recipe |
| **`nutrition`** | Nutrition information in the form:<br> `[calories, total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), carbohydrates (PDV)]` |
| **`n_steps`** | Number of preparation steps |
| **`steps`** | List of step-by-step instructions |
| **`description`** | User-provided recipe description |
| **`n_ingredients`** | Number of ingredients (computed during cleaning) |
| **`average_rating`** | Mean rating aggregated from the interactions table |

### **Ratings / Interactions Table**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **`user_id`** | ID of the user leaving a rating or review |
| **`recipe_id`** | ID of the recipe being reviewed |
| **`date`** | Date of the interaction |
| **`rating`** | Rating given (1–5; 0 indicates no rating provided) |
| **`review`** | Text of the user's review |

### Relevant Columns for Prediction

For predicting preparation time (`minutes`), the most relevant variables include:

- **`n_steps`** — procedural complexity  
- **`n_ingredients`** — number of components required  
- **nutritional features** — calorie density, sugar, protein, etc.  
- **`step_bin`** — binned complexity level  
- **engineered features** — such as calories-per-ingredient and steps-per-ingredient  

These features describe recipe structure and complexity, which logically influence preparation time.
